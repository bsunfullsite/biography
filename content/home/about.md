# Biography

Hello, I'm Bo Sun. I'm currently a Ph.D candidate major in Quantitative Biology. I have had years of research experience analyzing biology bigdata in genomics and high-throughput sequencing. I found my self obsessed with the interdisciplinary study of statistics and computer science, and I love to work and play with data on a day-to-day basis. I want to pursue a data science career path and commit my quantitative knowledge to help build products that will reach out and benefit more people. I like to code in python and try different things that python can do, like this joyful "character video" generator [here]({{< ref "/post/getting-started" >}})
