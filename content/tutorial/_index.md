In this _Tutorial_ widgets, I will publish content that **teach you to do staff** such as:

* **How I build and deploy this website with HUGO**
* **Online Courses and my notes on them**
* **My research workflow in Computational Bio(RNA-seq, genomics, etc)**

For general programming/data science/fun content, please see them in [posts]({{< ref "/post" >}}).

<!-- The parent folder may be renamed, for example, to `docs` for project documentation or `course` for creating an online course.

To disable this feature, either delete the parent folder, or set `draft = true` in the front matter of all its pages. 

After renaming or deleting the parent folder, you may wish to update any `[[menu.main]]` menu links to it in the `config.toml`.
